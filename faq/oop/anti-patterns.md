Anti-patterns, like their design pattern counterparts, define an industry
vocabulary for the common defective processes and implementations within
organizations. A higher-level vocabulary simplifies communication between software
practitioners and enables concise description of higher-level concepts.

An anti-pattern is a literary form that describes a commonly occurring solution
to a problem that generates decidedly negative consequences. The anti-pattern may
be the result of a manager or developer not knowing any better, not having
sufficient knowledge or experience in solving a particular type of problem, or
having applied a perfectly good pattern in the wrong context.

Anti-patterns provide real-world experience in recognizing recurring problems in
the software industry and provide a detailed remedy for the most common
predicaments. Anti-patterns highlight the most common problems that face the
software industry and provide the tools to enable you to recognize these problems
and to determine their underlying causes.

Furthermore, anti-patterns present a detailed plan for reversing these underlying
causes and implementing productive solutions. Anti-patterns effectively describe
the measures that can be taken at several levels to improve the developing of
applications, the designing of software systems, and the effective management of
software projects.

**[Software Development anti-patterns](/faq/object-oriented-programming/anti-patterns/software-development-antipatterns/)**

A key goal of development anti-patterns is to describe useful forms of software
refactoring. Software refactoring is a form of code modification, used to improve
the software structure in support of subsequent extension and long-term
maintenance. In most cases, the goal is to transform code without impacting
correctness.

**Software Architecture anti-patterns**

Architecture anti-patterns focus on the system-level and enterprise-level
structure of applications and components. Although the engineering discipline of
software architecture is relatively immature, what has been determined repeatedly
by software research and experience is the overarching importance of architecture
in software.

**Software Project Management anti-patterns**

In the modern engineering profession, more than half of the job involves human
communication and resolving people issues. The management anti-patterns identify
some of the key scenarios in which these issues are destructive to software processes.
