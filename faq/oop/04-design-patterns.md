Design patterns are recurring solutions to common problems in software designing.

## The recommended major Principles of Programming

It is recommend to acknowledge the following principles before starting with design patterns.
Without the strict following of this principles design patterns ( and OOP in general ) makes no sense.

* [K.I.S.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
* [D.R.Y.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
* [Principle of Parsimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)
* [Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
* [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)

## Types of design patterns

According to the Gang of Four book we can categorize design patterns into three main
categories:

### Creational

* [Abstract Factory](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/abstract-factory/)
* [Builder](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/builder/)
* [Prototype](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/prototype/)
* [Singleton](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/singleton/)

### Structural

* [Adapter](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/adapter/)
* [Bridge](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/bridge/)
* [Composite](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/composite/)
* [Decorator](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/decorator/)
* [Facade](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/facade/)
* [Flyweight](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/flyweight/)
* [Proxy](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/proxy/)

### Behavioral

* [Chain of responsibility](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility/)
* [Command](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/command/)
* [Intepreter](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/interpreter/)
* [Iterator](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/iterator/)
* [Mediator](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/mediator/)
* [Memento](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/memento/)
* [Observer](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/observer/)
* [State](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/state/)
* [Strategy](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/strategy/)
* [Template method](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/template-method/)
* [Visitor](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/visitor/)

### Other design patterns

Other design patterns that are important to know for complex applications:

* [Dependency injection](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/dependency-injection/)
* [Lazy loading](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/lazy-loading/)
* [Mock object](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/mock-object/)
* [Null object](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/null-object/)
* [Object pool](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/object-pool/)
* [Servant](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/servant/)
* [Type tunnel](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/type-tunnel/)
