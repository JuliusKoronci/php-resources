Dear reader, PHP (which stands for recursive backronym of "PHP: Hypertext
Preprocessor") is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
for writing web applications, dynamically generated pages and command line
interface scripts.

## Where to start?

PHP is located and best described on the official website
[PHP.net](http://php.net) with updated and in-depth [manual](http://php.net/manual).
Reading it is highly recommended to get to know PHP in details. As you will pass
through the manual pages you will progress with your knowledge. You can start
with the [Simple PHP Tutorial](http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php) to get
PHP up and running fast.

Use Google for most obvious issues you will find or ask on forums.
